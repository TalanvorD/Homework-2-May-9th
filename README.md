## User Story

>AS AN employer
>I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
>SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
>WHEN I load their portfolio
>THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
>THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
>THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
>THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
>WHEN I click on the images of the applications
>THEN I am taken to that deployed application
>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
>THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

This project is to create a page that showcases my portfolio which contains my name, a photo, links to previous projects and contact methods.
- Layout must be responsive to viewport.
    - @media screen has been utilized to change properties depending on the viewport.
- First showcased application must be larger than others.
    - First featured-project-card is larger in the larger 2 viewport settings and sizes down on the smallest for usability.
- Applications should have titled images.
    - Images are titled and have alt tags as well.
- Application links should go to said application.
    - Links go to where expected
- Navigation links need to work correctly.
    - Navigtation links exist and go to the correct id tags.
- Some amount of "zazz" should be shown.
    - The most nebulous item. Added a few changes on hover: box shadow for a glow effect, opacity change for a subtle pop on the images and a transition to ease the card up.
    - *Graphic design is my passion.*

## User Story

>AS AN employer
>I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
>SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
>WHEN I load their portfolio
>THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
>THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
>THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
>THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
>WHEN I click on the images of the applications
>THEN I am taken to that deployed application
>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
>THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

The project is to create a page that showcases my portfolio which contains my name, a photo, links to previous projects and contact methods.
1. Layout must be responsive to viewport.
2. First showcased application must be larger than others.
3. Applications should have titled images.
4. Application links should go to said application.
5. Navigation links need to work correctly.
6. Some amount of "zazz" should be shown.
